# WeekDay

This project is a job listings platform developed with React.js, CSS, and Material-UI. It allows users to browse and filter job listings, with features including job cards, filters, and infinite scroll.

## Features

- **Job Cards**: Each job listing is displayed as a card containing job title, company name, location, job description (with expandable option), experience required, and an apply button/link.

- **Filters**: Users can refine job listings based on minimum experience, company name, location, remote/on-site options, tech stack, role, and minimum base pay.

- **Infinite Scroll**: Implemented infinite scroll to load additional job listings automatically as the user scrolls down the page, providing a seamless browsing experience without the need for manual "Load More" clicks.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **CSS**: Styling for components and layout.
- **Material-UI**: React UI framework for designing responsive web applications.
